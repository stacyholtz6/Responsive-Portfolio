        Hi! My name is Stacy Holtz. I live in Colorado with my husband and two sons. One of my sons is about to become a tween. I'm slightly terrified. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up on a farm in Nebraska. I loved growing up on a farm. I learned how to work hard. After the work was done there was always time for fun. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved to Colorado in my 20's. I love the mountains. I wanted to be closer to them so I could enjoy them everyday instead of just on vacation. I never tire of the view. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had differnt career paths over the years.  I've always found technology interesting but intimdating. I've finally decided to take the plunge and make a career out of something I find interesting and challenging. I never want to stop learning.
